[color=#a4885c]01.[/color] Google's Gaggle Land is a private server. Do not share the connection address, unless you get direct approval.

[color=#a4885c]02.[/color] No slurs, hate speech, or anything nasty like that. This extends to "in-universe" speciesm.

[color=#a4885c]03.[/color] Absolutely no Erotic Roleplay (ERP) or sexual content. There is a fine line between being romantic and ERP, and you better not cross it.

[color=#a4885c]04.[/color] Metacomming must only extend to EXTREMELY basic terms. "I am playing a Scientist" is fine, but "I was killed by Urist McHands, a traitor!" is not. During major events (such as going off station as a team), or during Sandbox rounds, Metacomming rules do not apply. Still, don't be an asshole.

[color=#a4885c]05.[/color] Play your character. We expect High RP quality, not Low RP, and you will be expected to be playing one at all times. A character that's only gimmick is "They're an asshole" is not a good character, either, so don't play one.

[color=#a4885c]06.[/color] Avoid round removing people, even if they are your kill target. The point of this server is not to greentext, it's to create interesting stories.
