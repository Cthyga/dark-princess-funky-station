# Google's Gaggle Land Rules

  Space Station 14 is not like most games. Many rules are designed to require roleplay, and not all rules are intuitive. Please take the time to read and understand the rules before you play so that you aren't surprised. Some of our rules are zero tolerance rules, meaning that a violation will result in an indefinite ban without any warning. Game admins will treat you as if you have read the rules, even if you have not.

  ## Rules

	[color=#ff0000]DISCONNECTING FROM OR IGNORING/EVADING ADMIN-HELPS WILL RESULT IN ACCESS BEING REVOKED.[/color]

	[color=#a4885c]01.[/color] Google's Gaggle Land is a private server. Do not share the connection address, unless you get direct approval.

	[color=#a4885c]02.[/color] No slurs, hate speech, or anything nasty like that. This extends to "in-universe" speciesm.

	[color=#a4885c]03.[/color] Absolutely no Erotic Roleplay (ERP) or sexual content. There is a fine line between being romantic and ERP, and you better not cross it.

	[color=#a4885c]04.[/color] Metacomming must only extend to EXTREMELY basic terms. "I am playing a Scientist" is fine, but "I was killed by Urist McHands, a traitor!" is not. During major events (such as going off station as a team), or during Sandbox rounds, Metacomming rules do not apply. Still, don't be an asshole.

	[color=#a4885c]05.[/color] Play your character. We expect High RP quality, not Low RP, and you will be expected to be playing one at all times. A character that's only gimmick is "They're an asshole" is not a good character, either, so don't play one.

	[color=#a4885c]06.[/color] Avoid round removing people, even if they are your kill target. The point of this server is not to greentext, it's to create interesting stories.
