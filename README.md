This is a fork of Funky Station, which in itself is a fork of Goob Station. To prevent people forking RobustToolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server.

If you want to host or create content for SS14, or for Funky / Goob Station, go to the [Space Station 14 repository](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14), or the [Funky Station](https://github.com/funky-station/funky-station) / [Goob Station](https://github.com/Goob-Station/Goob-Station) repositories.

## Documentation/Wiki

The Goob Station [docs site](https://docs.goobstation.com/) has documentation on GS14's content, engine, game design, and more. It also has lots of resources for new contributors to the project.

## Contributing

We welcome everyone to contribute to our fork, but the actual target audience is very specific. As such, it is unlikely you will see much benefit from using this as a base for any work you do.
Seriously, don't spend your time on this if you aren't part of the whole thing. Or do, I'm not your dad.
The contribution guidelines are as follows:
1. It needs to not crash the server and make me cry. Oh, and work too, that also.
2. It needs to be fun(NY). While we aren't a "yeah throw random goofy shit in" fork, we also aren't a "KEEP IT IN UNIVERSE OR PERISH" fork.
3. It needs to be fair. No making a PR to give your character 30000 health and a gibstick. That's kinda weird.

## Building

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `RUN_THIS.py` to init submodules and download the engine.
3. Compile the solution.
